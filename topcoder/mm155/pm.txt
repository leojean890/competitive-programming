Hello ! Thanks @dimkadimon to create these amazing topics, and congratz to top players to have reached those scores

I reached 77 pts using the following aproach :

In the first step, I generate pseudo random moves in reverse order during 1 second 

First, I use random-greedy approach:
I construct a solution the folloing way :
If I find at least a square with a 5 multiplier, I choose randomly one of those. 
Else if I find a square with 3 multiplier, I choose randomly one of those. 
And so on

I choose the next node only if it has at least a possible son (targettable square).

Second, I use random-probabilistic approach during another second:

I use a bigger proba to take spots with big multipliers (5-3-2-1) or (20-12-8-1)

Then, I use SA to optimize it using the same probabilities.

Then I do some post-procssing from my best found list : 

For each pair of dots A-B from my best moves final list, I check if I can find C such as A-C-B is valid. If so I take it.

Then I check A-C to see if I can insert some other move.

Etc
