Hello ! This contest was very interesting. Congratz for the contest creation and to top players for reaching such scores.

I reached 92.15 pts using the following approach :

I'm using some randomized parameters and do many sims while some time is left.

Using another lapse of time, I only do mutations on "best parameters on average" found locally.

The scoring function to choose a target is a combination of :

- distance to each mushroom/hut
- a threshold enabling to favor on average the fact to go to a hut or a mushroom according to the amount of currently carried mushrooms 
and also depending on 
- avoid sending 2 collectors to the same mushroom (but sometimes I do that anyway..)
- favor collecting mushrooms with more value, because there are more to lose, particularly if RD is low.

BFS distances and related paths between interesting targets (starting points, huts, and mushrooms) are precomputed before the search.

Here is my final submit : https://github.com/leojean890/competitive-programming/blob/main/topcoder/mm153/submit.py
