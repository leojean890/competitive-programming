Hello ! Finally I'm ranked 17/44 with a score of 28.90 on provisionals.

My approach is inspired by Magus's CSB PM. I copied the sim from the referee (AccurateDynamic / moveCar / ApplyCommand) and I use a SA per turn using 8 ms per turn.
I use a state as a list of 16 succesives moves (accRight, accLeft) to be applied.
A transition is generating a new random (accRight, accLeft) for one of the 16 moves.

My scoring function is a combination of :
- amount of crossed checkpoints (bonus if I reach one of them earlier among the 16 simulated turns)
- distance to closest checkpoint from current positions
- amount of crossed grid-cells in the bfs path to the closest checkpoint (bonus if I reach each of them earlier among the 16 simulated turns) and distance to the next one
- big malus if my angular speed is too high (bigger malus if it happens earlier among the 16 simulated turns), else I was rotating endlessely :o:s
- big malus if I'm going out in the grass (bigger malus if it happens earlier among the 16 simulated turns)

My best reached scores per seed using this approach are the following.
My best code is the following (+2 locally VS last submit but I use 9900ms instead of 9000..).

One improvement axis would be to consider the TSP path instead of the "closest next checkpoint from current position"
It would use some more time in addition to the SA per turn used times.

In my replay of seed 1 I go straightforward to the goal (score 158 instead of my best which is 155).
In my replay of seed 3 I get all checkpoints but my car wants to do some hiking in the meantime ;) (score 1041 instead of my best which is 553).
In my replay of seed 2 I get 18 checkpoints out of 20 while struggling a bit and sometimes going out in the grass to have a better speed vector after restart, or sometimes my car manages to slow down before going out and get a bettter speed vector then.
