several algos tried :

1018924 with greedy
1020796 with dfs with the same greedy (try actions by local score order)
1021311 with A* (actions sorted by global score order - 100*depth)
1027948 with BS (width : 12) (same scoring)

1105151 : rafbill's algo

my best search gives only 10k bonus to my greedy score, but 78k needed to reach rafbill

it shows that a lot is missing on my search/greedy (heuristics/perfs/math simplifications/pruning/states diversification/whatever else) ^^
