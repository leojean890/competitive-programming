Hello !
First, congratz to CG for this amazing contest, and to top players to have created such strong bots.
I reached the overall 84th ranking (28th gold, 11th python overall) using heuristics.

First, I check if I can find a necessary smart move by spawning tentacles.
- w1 * distance (try to defend or attack more often if the opponent is close)
- w2 * amount of units to defend (i.e I have to spawn a tentacle to protect an ally unit which has a lot of sons, to avoid the overall destruction of all sons)
- w3 * amount of units to destroy (i.e I have to spawn a tentacle to kill an opponent unit which has a lot of sons, to destroy all its sons)



1) tentacles

                    currentBonus = 0 if _type == "TENTACLE" else 1.5

                    if distToRoot[idd] < 10:
                        currentBonus += 0.3 * (10 - distToRoot[idd])
                            score = currentBonus + nbSons[idsPerCoords[(u, v)]] - 5 * depth


- nbSons
- distToRoot
- resources vs takenResources
- if len(roots)*(100-turn) > money[resType] => forbidden
