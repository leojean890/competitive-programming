Congratz to CG for having this interesting contest idea and organizing it, and congratz to all players !

My overall approach is a bruteforce (depth 5) applied each turn for each player.

First, I apply it on both opponents moves. I score each reached state at depth 5.

eval : I consider that each opponent will play :

a move combination favoring several mini-games at once
mini-games with the least medals (3*g+s)
mini-games where their opponents have the least medals (to deny them)
mini-games for which the issue is NOT certain (if the gap between 2 players is huge in a mini-game, we may sometimes consider that the issue is fully or almost determined) => I use some ponderation about this criterion too
I use lower coeff for skating and normalized coeffs for other mini-games
I store/return each opponent’s state maximizing this eval at depth 5 to use it in the second part.

Second, I apply this bruteforce on my own moves. I score each reached state at depth 5.

I use almost the same eval than described upper but mostly considering if I’m beating the opponents “best reached state at depth 5” and at which point in each mini-game.

There is another criterion in the eval of my moves with bigger coeff : I add virtual medals (who is currently winning in each mini-game, or won it ?)
and I calculate the real score (multiplication) of each player considering the “new” amount of medals per mini-game per player.
This criterion is strongly ponderated in the eval of my moves.

I play the move maximizing this global eval.
